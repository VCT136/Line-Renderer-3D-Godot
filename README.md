# Line-Renderer-3D-Godot
 3D Line Renderer Script for Godot

Godot version 4.1

# Instructions
1. Create a MeshInstance3D and assign the LineRenderer.gd script to it.
2. Adjust the properties in the inspector; especially "Points", "Material", and "Camera Address".

# Background
I found the Line Renderer plugin by dbp8890 and paulohyy at https://github.com/dbp8890/line-renderer.
At the time it was not working in Godot 4.1, so I took the main script of their Line Renderer and adjusted it.
This Line Renderer now is easier to use, (in my opinion) as it only requires you to use one file and supports materials.
